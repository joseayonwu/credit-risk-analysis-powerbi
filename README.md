# Credit Risk Analysis — Power BI & Python Integration

Interactive **Power BI** dashboard analyzing credit risk using the **UCI Credit Card Default** dataset.  
This project integrates **Python (PCA and K-Means Clustering)** with Power BI to identify behavioral risk segments and optimize decision-making in financial management.

---

## Project Overview
This dashboard visualizes credit default behavior for over 30,000 customers.  
It includes DAX-driven KPIs and AI insights to evaluate key risk factors such as age, education, credit utilization, and payment behavior.

**Tools used:**
- Power BI (data modeling, DAX measures, visualization)
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib for PCA & clustering)
- Excel (data source)

## Dashboard Pages
1. **Overview:** Default rate (22.1%) and monthly payment coverage trends.  
2. **Comparative Analysis:** Behavioral differences between defaulters and non-defaulters.  
3. **Risk & Behavioral Profiles:** Risk scores by gender, marital status, and education.  
4. **Advanced Risk Analysis:** Correlations by age, education, and delinquency level.  
5. **AI-Driven Insights:** PCA-based segmentation and clustering of 4 customer groups.

## Key Insights
- Default rate: **22.1% overall**; highest among customers aged **60+**.  
- “Healthy Use” ratio (0.5–1.0) shows **lowest default at 15.7%**.  
- Higher education correlates with **lower risk**.  
- **Cluster 3** has the highest predicted default probability (**0.56**) and should be prioritized for monitoring.
